This module, Apache2::AuthenMSAD, is an Apache2/mod_perl2 authentication
handler to authenticate users using a Microsoft Active Directory
server. Authentication is an LDAP bind to the user's UserPrincipal name --
"$user\@$domain" (that's the "Kerberos" name, you can do the same bind to
"$domain\\$user")

To build and install it, please run

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

To read more about this module try

    pod2text AuthenMSAD.pm

It should be clear that this requires Apache v2.X with mod_perl2. Also
require correspondinunderlying perl packages including Apache2 and Net2::LDAP
